This is a simple application that allows users to add, update and delete blogs. Blogs also have a comment section, allowing users to post and like comments. The application uses [express](https://expressjs.com/) and [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) for CRUD functionality and [handlbars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) as a templating engine. Authentication is done through sessions with [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session).
